### Red Flag

"Red Flag" in a company culture means that any person can stand-up and speak-up of a company problem.
For example in some car companies any worker can stop conveyer if he know that there are quality issues.

### Protect

Those who raise red flag are to be given word to speak,
and protected to ensure that the practice will live. 

### Keep it inside company

While it can be touching life question, keep it inside company and do not let outside world know.
For example use `#redflag` tag in yammer (enterprise social network)
