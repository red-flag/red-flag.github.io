### Red Flag

"Red Flag" in a company culture means that any person can stand-up and openly and loudly speak-up of a company problem.
For example in some car companies any worker can stop assembly line (conveyer) if he knows that there are quality issues.

### Why

Otherwise some issue may become nobody's problem, or a problem will be hidden intentionally. 
For example linear managers controlling information flow and not letting any problem be known to higher or next unit.
Thus having less incentive to solve them. So of course disliking when raising of the issue happens.

### Protect

Those who raise red flag are to be given word to speak,
and protected to ensure that the practice will live. 

### Keep it inside company

While it can be touching life question, keep it inside company and do not let outside world know.
For example use enterprise social network (like Yammer) with `#red-flag` tag.

### Where

If this practice is officially supported within your organization, please allow to list it here.
